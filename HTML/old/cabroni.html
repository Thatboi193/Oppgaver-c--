        <h1>Ghost of Tsushima</h1>

        <p>The latest PS4 exclusive game from developer Sucker Punch is an attempt to merge the structure of a conventional open-world game with the setting of a classic samurai film. When things click, it’s amazing; Ghost is a beautiful game, one full of focused, contemplative moments, from tense, one-on-one sword duels to peaceful retreats to compose haiku under a tree.</p>

        <p>Ghost of Tsushima takes place in 13th century Japan when a Mongolian army has invaded the island of Tsushima. You play as Jin Sakai, one of the only remaining samurai on Tsushima following a large-scale attack that wiped out much of the warrior population. Initially, Jin’s goal is relatively small: he wants to rescue his uncle, leader of the Tsushima samurai, who has been captured by the Mongol leader. Eventually, the stakes get higher. Jin becomes the leader of a resistance force trying to thwart the invasion and keep it from spreading to the Japanese mainland.</p>

        <p>This process isn’t straightforward. The conflict at the core of the game isn’t just between two opposing armies, it’s also inside Jin himself. In the beginning, he’s a traditional samurai who faces his foes head-on and values honor above all else. But that doesn’t necessarily win you wars. As shown in the opening scene, the greatest samurai of the island challenges the Mongol leader, who promptly throws oil at the samurai then sets him on fire. To successfully fight off the ruthless invading force, which makes use of siege weapons and tactics designed to terrorize the enemy, Jin is forced to try different tactics.</p>

        <p>This plays out in a few different ways. The most important is the way Jin changes. He slowly moves away from his samurai upbringing to become something else, making use of stealth tactics, morally questionable weapons like poison darts, and more to become what the residents of Tsushima call simply “the ghost.” By the end, he’s basically a samurai Batman, armed with a huge array of combat skills and useful gadgets.</p>

        <p>But Jin can’t free Tsushima alone, which feeds into the structure of the game. A lot of the quests in Ghost of Tsushima are about preparing to fight the Mongols and eliminate their leader. That means drumming up support from the residents of the island but mostly a core group of four allies, among them a warrior monk and a disgraced bow master. Clearing out camps, towns, and farmland to set up safe zones are crucial for progression to liberate a section of Tsushima.</p>

        <p>It sounds cool but for the most part, it plays out much like any other game in the genre. The missions, in particular, the side quests can be painfully generic. They almost all involve going to an area, clearing it of enemies, and possibly collecting an important item along the way. Some require stealth, others climbing or tracking, and almost every one forces you to walk or ride alongside another character while they tell you something seemingly important.</p>

        <p>Ghost of Tsushima is a well-made game, but it often feels dull and repeating the same mistakes of other open-world titles. You may feel like you’ve been transported to 13th century Japan, but that doesn’t mean you can get away from explosive red barrels or the turret sequence.</p>

        <p>A great example of the game’s great features is the combat and exploration. Jin is a samurai master, and he controls like you imagine a samurai master would, quick and agile performing split-second dodges and then countering with a fast and accurate strike. Throughout the game, you’ll learn different stances, each of which works particularly well against a specific type of enemy and has slightly different controls to match. The result is that combat feels different depending on whether you’re up against a big, hulking brute or a skilled swordsman with a shield.</p>

        <p>Likewise, the game encourages exploration and pushes you toward goals in often subtle ways. There’s a feature called “guiding wind” which is exactly what it sounds like: you’ll see a gust of wind pointing in the direction of your current objective. It’s mostly a gentle reminder, as opposed to the firm push games typically give the player. When it comes to exploration, there’s a similarly light touch, you might see a golden bird or brown fox, nudging you to follow them toward something interesting.</p>

        <p>My absolute favorite moments in Ghost of Tsushima are when things are stripped down to their very core. For key battles, the game utilizes a dueling format that is incredibly stripped down. There are no stances or special weapons. It’s just you and a sword, using timing and quick reflexes to defeat your opponent.</p>

        <p>Ghost of Tsushima just doesn’t dig far enough into what makes it unique. It’s big and beautiful — but you have to have the patience of a samurai to discover what makes it truly special.</p>
