                <span><h1>NASA Reveals Incredible X-59: A Unique, Experimental Supersonic Jet</h1></span>
                <span><h3>The term space plane conjures up all sorts of images and NASA, with their new X-59 (even the name sounds mysterious) they have definitely not disappointed.

                    Their new quiet supersonic aircraft has been designed to minimize the sonic boom it creates when it crosses the speed of sound. It will fly at 1.4 times the speed of sound and is set for its maiden flight later this year. </h3></span>

                <span><h1>Google confirms it just laid off around a thousand employees</h1></span>
                <span><h3>Turns out Google’s postpandemic reckoning didn’t just hit the Google Hardware team responsible for Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit products — it’s taken similarly sized bites out of Google’s core engineering and Google Assistant teams too. Google just confirmed to The Verge that it’s eliminated “a few hundred” roles in each of these divisions, meaning Google has confirmed layoffs of around a thousand employees on Wednesday alone</h3></span>

                <span><h1>They’re not cheap, but Nvidia’s new Super GPUs are a step in the right direction</h1></span>
                <span><h3>If there’s been one consistent criticism of Nvidia’s RTX 40-series graphics cards, it’s been pricing. All of Nvidia’s product tiers have seen their prices creep up over the last few years, but cards like the 4090 raised prices to new heights, while lower-end models like the 4060 and 4060 Ti kept pricing the same but didn’t improve performance much.</h3></span>
